# 🤖 AI Usage Guidelines - QHO640

## Overview
This document provides guidance on responsible AI usage in Contemporary Web Applications coursework, ensuring learning objectives are met while acknowledging the reality of AI tools in modern development.

## 🎯 AI Usage Policy

### ✅ **Encouraged AI Usage**
- **Learning assistance**: Understanding concepts and debugging
- **Code explanation**: Getting help understanding complex patterns
- **Research support**: Finding best practices and contemporary approaches
- **Documentation help**: Improving README and comment clarity

### ⚠️ **Conditional AI Usage** (Must Document)
- **Code generation**: If used, must be documented and explained
- **Problem-solving**: Must show your decision-making process
- **Architecture decisions**: Must justify AI suggestions vs. alternatives

### ❌ **Prohibited AI Usage**
- **Complete assignment generation** without understanding
- **Copy-paste without modification or understanding**
- **Process documentation** (reflection must be personal)
- **Assessment submissions** without disclosure

## 📝 Documentation Requirements

When using AI tools, students must include:

### 🔍 **AI Transparency Section**
```markdown
## AI Usage Declaration
- **Tools Used**: [e.g., ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, Claude]
- **Usage Type**: [Code generation, debugging, explanation, research]
- **Extent**: [Percentage of work, specific components]
- **Learning Outcome**: [What you learned from AI interaction]
```

### 🧠 **Understanding Demonstration**
- **Code explanation**: Line-by-line breakdown of AI-generated code
- **Modification rationale**: Why you changed or kept AI suggestions
- **Alternative approaches**: Other solutions you considered
- **Personal improvements**: How you enhanced AI output

### 📊 **Decision Process**
- **Problem identification**: Your analysis of the challenge
- **AI prompt strategy**: How you structured AI requests
- **Evaluation process**: How you assessed AI suggestions
- **Final implementation**: Your personal touches and modifications

## 🎯 Assessment Adaptation

### 📋 **Enhanced Evaluation Criteria**

| Component | Weight | AI Impact | Evaluation Method |
|-----------|--------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Technical Implementation** | 25% | High AI risk | Focus on customization and optimization |
| **Process & Understanding** | 30% | Low AI risk | Documentation, explanation, live demo |
| **Problem-Solving & Design** | 25% | Medium AI risk | Creative solutions, user research |
| **Communication & Reflection** | 20% | Low AI risk | Personal learning journey, decision rationale |

### 🔧 **Practical Assessment Components**

#### **1. Live Code Explanation (10 minutes)**
- Walk through your implementation
- Explain key architectural decisions
- Demonstrate understanding of core concepts
- Show how you modified or improved AI suggestions

#### **2. Problem-Solving Session (15 minutes)**
- Debug a provided code sample
- Implement a small feature extension
- Explain your thought process
- No AI tools allowed

#### **3. Reflective Documentation**
- Learning journey narrative
- Challenge identification and resolution
- Technology choice justification
- Personal growth and skill development

## 🌟 **Best Practices for AI-Enhanced Learning**

### 🔄 **Iterative Development with AI**
1. **Initial attempt**: Try solving problems yourself first
2. **AI consultation**: Use AI for guidance and alternative approaches
3. **Critical evaluation**: Assess AI suggestions against your understanding
4. **Personal enhancement**: Add your own improvements and optimizations
5. **Documentation**: Record your decision-making process

### 🧪 **Experimental Approach**
- **Compare solutions**: Generate multiple AI approaches, choose best
- **Test understanding**: Implement AI suggestions without copy-paste
- **Extend functionality**: Add features beyond AI recommendations
- **Optimize performance**: Improve AI code for your specific use case

### 📚 **Learning-Focused Usage**
- **Concept exploration**: Use AI to understand new technologies
- **Code review**: Ask AI to explain existing code patterns
- **Best practices**: Research contemporary development approaches
- **Debugging assistance**: Get help understanding error messages

## 🚫 **Academic Integrity Boundaries**

### ✅ **Acceptable Practices**
- Using AI to understand course concepts
- Getting help with debugging and optimization
- Researching best practices and contemporary approaches
- Generating initial code templates for modification

### ❌ **Unacceptable Practices**
- Submitting AI-generated work without understanding
- Copying AI code without modification or learning
- Using AI for assessment components without disclosure
- Claiming AI work as original creation

## 🎯 **Success Strategies**

### 📈 **Maximize Learning with AI**
1. **Question everything**: Ask AI to explain its suggestions
2. **Experiment actively**: Try different approaches and compare
3. **Document decisions**: Keep track of why you chose specific solutions
4. **Teach others**: Explain your AI-enhanced solutions to peers
5. **Continuous improvement**: Iterate on AI suggestions with personal enhancements

### 🏆 **Stand Out from AI-Generated Work**
- **Personal problem selection**: Choose unique, meaningful project domains
- **Creative implementations**: Add unexpected features and interactions
- **User research**: Include real user feedback and testing
- **Performance optimization**: Go beyond basic functionality
- **Accessibility focus**: Implement inclusive design principles
- **Contemporary techniques**: Research and apply cutting-edge approaches

## 📞 **Support and Guidance**

- **Office hours**: Discuss AI usage strategies and assessment concerns
- **Peer discussion**: Share experiences and approaches with classmates
- **Course forums**: Ask questions about appropriate AI usage
- **Industry mentorship**: Connect with professionals about real-world AI usage
